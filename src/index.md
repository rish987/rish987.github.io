Hello!
I'm Rish, a PhD student in computer science at the
  [Laboratoire Méthodes Formelles](https://lmf.cnrs.fr/) (LMF) 
in
  [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/),
part of the 
  [Deducteam](https://deducteam.gitlabpages.inria.fr/)
research group.
I am supervised by
  [Frédéric Blanqui](https://blanqui.gitlabpages.inria.fr/)
on the design and implementation of
a tool for translating between
[Lean](https://lean-lang.org/) and [Dedukti](https://deducteam.github.io/),
and I expect to complete my doctoral studies in March 2026.

I’m generally interested in the use of **proof assistants**
for mathematical formalization and synthesis,
with my doctoral research focusing on
the topic of **proof translation** for improved interoperability
between proof assistants based on different foundations.

My broader research interests are around the topic of using proof assistants such as Lean
as platforms for the **synthesis of verified structural artifacts**
starting from domain-specific, user-provided symbolic specifications, background theories and related proof automation.
I am particularly interested in designing proof-guided search spaces
for specific synthesis tasks,
focused especially on
the topics of **program synthesis**, **program specification synthesis**, and **subroutine discovery**
within proof assistants.

I am also interested in applications of synthesis techniques to general **automated reasoning**,
specifically in the areas of **metaprogram/tactic synthesis**, **automated theorem proving**,
and **machine-assisted mathematical discovery**.

I am actively seeking post-doctoral/full-time research positions along these lines!
