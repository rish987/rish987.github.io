Hello!
I'm Rish, a CS PhD student at the
  [Laboratoire MÃ©thodes Formelles](https://lmf.cnrs.fr/) (LMF) 
in
  [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/),
part of the 
  [Deducteam](https://deducteam.gitlabpages.inria.fr/)
research group.
I am supervised by
  [FrÃ©dÃ©ric Blanqui](https://blanqui.gitlabpages.inria.fr/)
on the design and implementation of
a tool for translating between
[Lean](https://lean-lang.org/) and [Dedukti](https://deducteam.github.io/),
and I expect to complete my doctoral studies in February 2026.

I'm generally interested in the use of **proof assistants**
for formalizing mathematics and verifying/synthesizing provably correct programs.
My doctoral studies relate to the topic of **proof translation** between proof assistants,
for improved interoperability between proof systems with different theoretical foundations.

My post-doctoral research interests are
around the areas of **program verification** and **program synthesis**,
specifically within the context of proof assistants such as Lean.
I'm interested in designing **search spaces** and **intelligent agents** for program synthesis,
**program specification synthesis**, and **subroutine discovery**,
as well as applications of program synthesis to **automated reasoning** tasks,
in particular those of
**metaprogram/tactic synthesis**, **automated theorem proving**,
and the **automated discovery of mathematical theories** within proof assistants.
I'm actively searching for post-doc positions along these lines!
